I. Adding the laird-cp layer to your build
=================================================

--- replace with specific instructions for the laird-cp layer ---

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the laird-cp layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the laird-cp layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-laird-cp \
    "


II. Misc
========

This layer provides the following modules:
    - Sterling & Summit 60, LWB, LWB5 Wi-Fi driver and firmware
    - Sterling & Summit WPA supplicant
    - Laird NetworkManager

 - To use Wi-Fi driver add "backports-laird" and appropriate firmware recipe
   to your image
   1. Remove cfg80211 and mac80211 from the kernel config
   2. Explicitly add the cfg80211 and mac80211 dependencies to the kernel config

 - To use Laird Network Manager add "laird-networkmanager" recipe to your image

 - Layer provides a set custom images that could be used as example or a base for building ones own

 - To use Sterling WPA Supplicant add "sterling-supplicant" recipe to your
   image, and in local.conf or <disto>.conf add the following:
        PREFERRED_PROVIDER_wpa-supplicant = "sterling-supplicant"
        PREFERRED_PROVIDER_wpa-supplicant-cli = "sterling-supplicant-cli"
        PREFERRED_PROVIDER_wpa-supplicant-passphrase = "sterling-supplicant-passphrase"

 - Summit or LWB packages needs to be manually downloaded and placed into
    <yocto top dir>/release folder (if needed)
